    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a professional historian, author, educator, and emerging web developer. My research interests
      include the 19th century American West, the Civil War, Native America, slavery, American economics,
      politics, and nationalism. I am currently completing my dissertation discussing the question of
      loyalty on the Pacific Coast on the eve of the Civil War. I explore the development of a western
      identity along the Pacific and the conflicts that emerged in competition with other regional identities
      and northern and southern nationalism.</p>
      <p>I am currently completing my Ph.D. in American History at Oklahoma State University this summer. I
        also have a Master's and Bachelor's degree in History and a Bachelor's degree in Secondary
        English Education from Eastern Washington University, and I hold a Bachelor's degree in English
        Language and Literature from the University of Washington. In addition to my degrees, I am
        certified in Program Assessment, which is the process of developing, conducting, and reviewing
        assessment within an academic program.</p>
